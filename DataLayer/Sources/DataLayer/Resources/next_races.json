In the money last time at this track (57.26) in a OR3, finishing a 0.8 lengths second. Has the ability and looks a key chance here. LUNA JEZABELLE (4) has a strong record this track and trip with four wins and four placings from nine starts. In the money last time at this track (34.12) in a OR, finishing a 2.75 lengths third. With even luck and a clean start should be thereabouts. PATSYS ME DADDY (2) was out of the placings last time but before that was an impressive winner (45.81) in a OR at this track. Key player on best and worth another try. ROSEVILLE EMILY (1) can finish much closer after missing a cheque at this track last start.",
