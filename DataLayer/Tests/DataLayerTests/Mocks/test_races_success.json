Now under the care of new trainer Leonardo Jose Dos Reis. He is the one to beat fresh up. QUENY LEE (5) resumes after a break of 12 weeks. Won on debut to launch the last campaign over 1200m at Cidade Jardim. Makes plenty of appeal. MEDSHOW (2) doesn't boast the best winning strike rate but ran a strong race last time out, finishing second and beaten only 1.3 lengths over 1000m at this track. Looks well placed so expect a big run this time. POLO NORTE (1) has been struggling to make an impression lately but gets his best chance in a while to put his hoof in the till. One more chance.",
